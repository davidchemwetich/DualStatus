## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Before publishing, you need to replace the test AdMob IDs with your own real IDs.

1.  **Android**: Update the AdMob App ID in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:
    ```xml
    <meta-data
        android:name="com.google.android.gms.ads.APPLICATION_ID"
        android:value="ca-app-pub-YOUR_ADMOB_APP_ID"/>
    ```

2.  **iOS** (if you plan to support it): Update the AdMob App ID in `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:
    ```xml
    <key>GADApplicationIdentifier</key>
    <string>ca-app-pub-YOUR_ADMOB_APP_ID</string>
    ```

3.  **Ad Unit IDs**: Replace the test ad unit IDs in `lib/services/ad_manager.dart` with your own.
